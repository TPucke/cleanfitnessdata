## Variables

Our final tidy data set contains the following Columns

1. Subject
2. Activity 

Our original dataset contained 561 values per observation.  These values were filtered down to 86 values so we only had those that contained mean, Mean or std.  In the tidydata set a mean of these was taken for each subject and activity observation.

## Units

- Subject : Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- Activity : One of 6 activities the subject was performing at the time of the experiment. These are laying, sitting, standing, walking, walking downstairs and walking upstairs
- Body Acceleration : The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
- Body Gyroscope : The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 
- Time : seconds
- Frequency : Hertz
